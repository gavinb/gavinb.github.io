I was just reading an interesting story about how [Oracle has released some libraries that provide clustering over Firewire for Linux](http://otn.oracle.com/tech/linux/open_source.html).
Very cool stuff - and even better, they are releasing the code under the GPL!

Now Bill Gates would have us think that the GPL will eat all your IP, and
corporations should stay away from it.  So why would a company like Oracle
release software under the GPL at all?

Because the GPL will actually **protect** them.  It all of a sudden came to me,
and it makes so much sense.  First, the question is simply whether to release
your code or not, and that is not an easy question to answer for many large
companies.  But once you decide to, how do you choose a license?  One of the
biggest fears companies seem to have when you talk about open sourcing their
code is losing their competitive advantage, or giving away their secrets to
competitors.

If they were to use almost any other license (such as the BSD license) then this
is entirely possible.  One of Oracle's competitors can take the code and use it
to their advantage without having to publish the code.

But if they use the GPL, competitors will be obliged to publish the code if they
change it (and redistribute the software) and only use it in GPLed software.  So
really, in this case it **protects** Oracle from their code being exploited,
because it mandates a level playing field.  Any improvements to their code will
be contributed back.

I think I will rewrite this into a more coherent story... I just thought I
should write it down first, before I forget!
