Last night, I braved the madding crowds at the local suburban cinema complex,
and went to see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets...

Don't worry - there are no spoilers here...

In short, it was a fantastic movie.  The special effects were excellent, the
story was a rollocking good romp, and the casting was great.  The film is not
identical to the book, but it is faithful enough, and most entertaining.

Most of the same old familiar characters were there, along with a few new ones.
I thought Kenneth Branagh was great as Professor Lockheart.

If you have read the book, you are sure to enjoy the film.  And if you see the
film, you will definitely want to read the book afterwards, to get all the extra
detail and background about the story.

I give it 4.5 stars.  (I'm saving the other 0.5 star for the next LOTR
installment...!)
