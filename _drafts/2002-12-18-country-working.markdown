Here I am in Mooroopna, just near Shepparton in Country Victoria.  I'm doing
some consulting work, very hush hush...

Well, not really. I am doing some Software Engineering work for a company
working on an industrial vision system. Very interesting work actually.

I am still trying to figure out how you can have a town with 2 restaurants and 7
bottle shops...

It's hot - damn hot, and dry. I have been lucky enough to go for some great
cycling treks to Shep, via the very good bike track through the forest, around
the lake...

Only one problem now - Christmas shopping! I will have to do it all this
weekend. Bummer... I think I'm becoming agoraphobic.

Now there's a place ... oooopnas.  That Mooroopna is actually and Aboriginal
name. It means somewhat literally "deep water".

Nearby Tallygaroopna means "tall trees".

Kannygoopna means "place where big fish live".

Seems it's all big in the "oooopnas"!
