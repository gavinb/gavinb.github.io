One of the biggest surprises at [this year's
WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/) was when Apple
announced the new [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming
language.  I have been experimenting with the Xcode 6 beta and have been
incredibly impressed by what I have seen so far. There an [excellent Swift
programming
guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)
available (for free) in iBooks for the language.

Swift has been strongly influenced by functional programming languages such
as Haskell, and has numerous functional style features.
