I get a large number of people coming to this site, apparently searching for a
definition of the word "antonym".  So as a service to all these people, here it
is:

> **an"to*nym** (noun)
>
> [Greek: a word used in substitution for another]
>
> A word of opposite meaning ; a counter-term ; used as a correlative of synonym

I hope that is a useful definition for you. If you still want more, please try
the following fine dictionaries:

 *  [Merriam-Webster](http://www.m-w.com/)
 * [Google's list of Online Dictionaries](http://directory.google.com/Top/Reference/Dictionaries/)
