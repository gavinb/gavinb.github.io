Recently I went on a holiday.  The first holiday in what seems like a very long
time...

I spent an entire week at a friend's holiday house by the bay. It was so
relaxing...

We awoke in the morning, had breakfast, then went to the beach.  Swim, walk,
relax, talk... then lunch, then usually a short drive to the surf beach a little
further south.  And then -

Wave jumping, more swimming, body surfing, sandcastles, and even more swimming.

And every night when we got back to the flat, we would cook a completely new
recipe that we'd never tried before.  And - fortunately - they were all good!

Aside from all the swimming and relaxing, I got in quite a bit of reading.  And
one of the best things about the trip was that for an entire week, I was so
_free_...

I was free from email, telephones, mobiles, interruptions, seminars, support
calls, dumb questions, bills and spam.

I was also free in that I walked around in bathers and a t-shirt, with no watch
or phone or wallet - no posessions weighing me down.  Well, apart from my hat
and sunglasses, which were essential given the weather!

I resolved to make a few changes after that trip - it was more than just a quick
getaway; I learned a few things, in the book and without...
