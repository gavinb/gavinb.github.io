The faster your computer, the more productive you are, right?  You can compile your project more quickly, run more unit tests in the same amount of time, find bugs more quickly... Or will it make you lazy and rot your brain?

Fast computers have made us lazy.  Fast compilers and IDEs have made developers particularly lazy.  While much of this has been in response to the increasing complexity of APIs we have to remember...

Calculators degrade mental numeracy

Device driver dev has a cost
Higher the cost, the more you think

When the cost of an action is negligible...

Digital cameras reduced the cost of taking photo to near zero. So instead of planning shots and thinking about composition and framing, we reel off hundreds of shots in a session and hope that 2 or 3 turn out to be good.  (Of course, the instant feedback certainly helps.)
