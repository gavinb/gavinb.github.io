I fell into the trap of thinking that every blog entry had to be fascinating,
amazing, new, whiter, brighter and generally earth-shattering. But curiously I
often read very popular blogs where people write about topics or techniques that
I would consider obvious. And then one day it struck me - I was taking a great
deal for granted.

So I decided I will start writing more articles (short ones that make it to
publishable stage!) about some of these things. It will almost certainly be
about software development, but not strictly so. Who knows what tangent I might
strike out on...?

It will also give me a chance to exercise this new blog. Hopefully Google will
actually start indexing it properly now.
