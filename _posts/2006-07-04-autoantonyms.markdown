What is the antonym (word of opposite meaning) to the word "resign"?  One correct answer is "resign".  What about the opposite of "dust"?  Yup, 10 points for "dust".

Confused?  These words are **autoantonyms**, one word that can have two opposite meanings!  See a full list of [autoantonyms at "Fun With Words"](http://www.fun-with-words.com/nym_autoantonyms.html).
